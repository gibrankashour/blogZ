## Notes

- I use mailtrap to test emails so in `.env` file you must update `MAIL_USERNAME` and `MAIL_PASSWORD` to your mailtrap sittings to send emails to your account
- I used mail feature when user creates new account and when sends message to adminstration and when admin replays to his message
- I used `spatie Laravel-permission` package to achive permissions and roles for admins
- I used `redis` to save some informations which appear in multiple pages in cache 
- Database name is `blogz` and just type this command  `php artisan migrate:fresh --seed ` to create database tables with its initiate data like permissions and roles information and fake data for posts and comments
- All accounts have the same password `123`
